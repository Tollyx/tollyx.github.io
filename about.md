My name is Adrian Hedqvist, and this is a page that's about me.

I'm a swedish guy born year 1996 and I enjoys games, programming and music.

The first game I remember playing was Lemmings.

My current favorite tabletop game is One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

I began studying Game design and programming at
[Campus Gotland](http://www.campusgotland.uu.se/en) in August, 2015.

I'm really bad at coming up with stuff to write about myself.
