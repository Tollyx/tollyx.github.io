The evening after the second big and public playtest, me and [Sebastian]() went out and got something to eat. We obviously started to discuss the feedback we had gotten during the playtest and both agreed that the game wasn't really up to snuff, we were missing *something*. The game at this point also felt a bit too complicated, too hard to explain to new players. There was also a bunch of dead time while playing that wasn't fun to sit through. So we started talking, we've got two weeks, how do we fix the game? It'll have to be through cutting features and simplifying things, we don't have much time for anything else.

The first thing we agreed on (and was also part of the feedback we had gotten) was that the game needed to be faster. Smaller rooms, no turns where all you can do is chase after some enemy. The one thing I had the most fun with while I was playtesting with some others were quite simply the moment I started fighting the player who was the traitor - what if we just try to compress everything about the game and make everything focus on that specific part?

The idea we came up with was that we should really just compress the entire dungeon we had thought up into a single room that is played in 5-10 minutes, call that a "round", give players points for their objectives that they managed to complete and then start a new round in a new room with new objectives given to the players. The "co-op" part of the game would mostly be thrown out of the window. The different objectives means that the game becomes a full-on deathmatch, each player is trying to do different things in the same room and the only reasons they have to be hostile to each other is if their objective requires it or if they want to sabotage things for each other.

The interface also needs quite a bit of simplifying as well. That nice queueing system I worked so hard on? Yeah, it's too cumbersome, we'll probably go back to something we had earlier and ditch the idea of "action points" altogether, and make it so you can move once per turn for a set of tiles and then attack once. It should make things easier to understand for new players as well.

None of this is tested yet and I'm writing this during the weekend, so Sebastian and I haven't discussed these ideas with the rest of the group yet. But this should make the game faster and focus the game on the part of the game that I found to be the most fun during playtesting - trying to predict what the other players are going to do and outsmarting them.

These last two weeks are going to be challenging for sure.
