    You got a new Highscore!

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                <p>This week I finished our highscore system, but when I say finished I actually mean &ldquo;we finally got this thing working properly don&rsquo;t touch it&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve actually been working on the highscore system on and off for a few weeks now and it didn&rsquo;t work nicely until recently. And we still need to work a bit on the UI. Why it took so long is because we had a bunch of small problems that together caused a pretty large mess.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/06XxDVS.png" alt="We still need to work on that UI." /></p>

<p>Let me list off the issues that it still had when I started working on it this week:</p>

<ol>
<li>The text you input was all garbled garbage.</li>
<li>The UI scaled incorrectly between fullscreen and windowed.</li>
<li>The list saved and loaded properly, but the UI didn&rsquo;t update correctly right after entering a new highscore.</li>
<li>There was no title to the menu</li>
<li>There was no indication that you had a new highscore and could enter your name</li>
</ol>

<p>Out of those five I&rsquo;ve fixed the first three. I&rsquo;m going to work on the last two tomorrow.</p>

<p>As for the first, it was a really stupid mistake that took way too long to discover: We were using <code>KeyPressedEvent</code>s and not <code>TextInputEvent</code>s. I think the reason why we did that was simply because we thought we were using TextInput when we were&rsquo;nt. The <code>sf::Event</code> class that has all the event types baked into it no matter what event type it actually is doesn&rsquo;t help either. If we just had checked if the event that we were using actually were a TextInputEvent we would&rsquo;ve saved so much trouble.</p>

<p>The second one was a simple fix, instead of placing and scaling things statically, do everything in relation to the window size. Something like this:<br />
<code>highscore.setPosition(window.getSize().x * 0.3, window.getSize().y * 0.2);</code></p>

<p>The third was a bit more tricky. The names and score names were only stored in two arrays (one for names, one for scores) with <code>sf::Text</code> objects. This made it pretty hard to simply insert a new highscore and push the others down a step. I solved it by adding a vector with name-score structs. When I add a new score I insert it at its position in the vector, erase the now 11th score in the list and then update the arrays with <code>sf::Text</code>s so they match the highscore vector. I&rsquo;ll have to redo it if I want the text entry to be at the position you get in the list, but I&rsquo;ll look for other solutions before remaking anything.</p>
